Rework the ``matplotlib.backends`` hook to attempt performing
auto-detection of the used backend(s) instead of collecting all
available backends. Implement :ref:`hook configuration option
<matplotlib hook options>` that allows users to swich between
this new behavior and the old behavior of collecting all backends,
or to manually specify the backend(s) to be collected.
