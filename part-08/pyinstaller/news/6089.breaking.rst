(macOS) App bundles built in ``onefile`` mode do not perform
:ref:`argv emulation <macos event forwarding and argv emulation>` by
default anymore. The functionality of converting initial open document/URL
events into ``sys.argv`` entries must now be explicitly opted-in,
via ``argv_emulation=True`` argument to ``EXE()`` in the .spec file
or via :option:`--argv-emulation` command-line flag.
