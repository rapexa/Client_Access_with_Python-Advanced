Implement support for PEP540 UTF-8 mode to match behavior of Python
interpreter (applicable to Python 3.7 and later). The UTF-8 mode can be
explicitly enabled or disabled via ``PYTHONUTF8`` environment variable.
Unless explicitly disabled, it is auto-enabled on linux and macOS when
locale is set to ``C`` or ``POSIX``.
